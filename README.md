# turnip_for_me
In this assignment you will write your own shell in C, similar to bash. No other languages, including C++, are allowed, though you may use any version of C you like, such as C99. The shell will run command line instructions and return the results similar to other shells you have used, but without many of their fancier features.

In this assignment you will write your own shell, called smallsh.  This will work like the bash shell you are used to using, prompting for a command line and running commands, but it will not have many of the special features of the bash shell.

Your shell will allow for the redirection of standard input and standard output and it will support both foreground and background processes (controllable by the command line and by receiving signals).

Your shell will support three built in commands: exit, cd, and status. It will also support comments, which are lines beginning with the # character.

During the development of this program, take extra care to only do your work on our class server, as your software will likely negatively impact whatever machine it runs on, especially before it's finished. If you cause trouble on one of the non-class, public servers, it could hurt your grade! If you are having trouble logging in to any of our EECS servers because of runaway processes, please use this page to kill off any programs running on your account that might be blocking your access:
